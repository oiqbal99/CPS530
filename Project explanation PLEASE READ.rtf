Despite having all the project files completed, we were unable to get the website working on the server. I continually ran into issues with the javascript pack tag, which meant we were unable to integrate react and ruby. After restarting the server (our web address was cps530.fun), I found I was unable to get it running again without doing so manually and having it running on the computer.}
